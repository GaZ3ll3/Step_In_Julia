      "\n",
      "Linear algebra functions in ``Julia`` are largely implemented by calling functions from [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack). Sparse factorizations call functions from SuiteSparse.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Matrices factorization ###\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For factorization algorithms, ``Julia`` has already implemented common routines as ``lu``, ``qr`` and ``chol``. The routines call ``LAPACK`` subroutines for decomposition algorithm in general. For example, ``lufact!`` calls ``LAPACK.getrf!`` to update matrices in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "``` \n",
      "    function lufact!{T<:BlasFloat}(A::StridedMatrix{T};  pivot = true)\n",
      "        !pivot && return generic_lufact!(A,pivot = pivot)\n",
      "        lpt =  LAPACK.getrf!(A)\n",
      "        return LU{T, typeof(A)}(lpt[1], lpt[2], lpt[3])\n",
      "    end\n",
      "```\n",
      "And ``LAPACK.getrf!`` calls ``getrf`` against the ``liblapack`` from ``GOTOBLAS2``.\n",

      "### Pivoting ###\n",
      "\n",
      "Since ``lu`` normally take ``1/3 min(m,n)^2 (3 max(m,n) - min(m,n))`` flops to compute the factorization. We usually will consider using **partial** pivoting(``getrf``), which requires O(n^2) comparisons in total, when ``m = n ``. \n",
      "\n",
      "An expensive pivoting strategy is **complete** pivoting, we try to avoid using it, since it costs too many operations O(n^3) on comparisons, and the performance does not differ too much from partial pivot case in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is another pivoting strategy between above two, which is call ``rook``. It keeps searching the pivot in current row and then search the pivot in the column of previous pivot and so on, until there is no more to search. This practically gives a reasonable reduce in comparison process, taking a tiny multiple of the cost of partial pivoting, and could get nearly complete pivoting performance. **Anyway**, ``rook`` can sometimes take O(n^3) comparisons.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Growth Factor ###\n",
      "\n",
      "``Growth factor`` is defined as tha ratio of maximal(in magnitude) element of result matrix at ``k``th stage and at ``0``th stage. And it is proved that the factor grows no faster than exponential.\n",
      "\n",
      "``Growth factor`` basically is a rule to judge whether pivoting method is good or not. \n"
